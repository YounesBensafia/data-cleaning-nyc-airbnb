# data-cleaning-nyc-airbnb

I am currently learning data cleaning by working on the New York City Airbnb Data Cleaning Project. This project focuses on preprocessing and refining the publicly available Airbnb dataset for New York City to ensure it is accurate, consistent, and suitable for analysis or machine learning applications.

As part of this project, I am exploring various data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies. Through this hands-on experience, I aim to strengthen my data wrangling skills and gain practical insights into preparing real-world datasets for advanced analytics.
